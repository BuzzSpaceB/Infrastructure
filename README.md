BuzzSpace B Infrastructure

How to use:
To install it with npm, use "npm install https://github.com/BuzzSpaceB/Infrastructure/tarball/master".
Whoever is going to use this module, is going to call each function to do a specific function.

Mock files:
The mock files are used by us (the integration team) to simulate what our functional teams' code should do. It is merely
for testing purposes. At the top of the Infrastructure.js file, we require our mock files. This should be replaced by 
requiring our functional teams' files.
